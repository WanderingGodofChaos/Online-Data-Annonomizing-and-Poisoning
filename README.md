# Online-Data-Annonomizing-and-Poisoning
My steps to not just anonymize data but poison the data

For a long time data has been collected on us and sold to anyone whith enough money to buy it. I've been to to annonomize my data so the data brokers cant track me down for years but I've decided to go a step futher. Posion my public data. My thinking is if you annonomize most of your data they will still have good data on you to build a case file. I think if you give the algorithms a whole bunch of bad data, they wont be able to tell what is accurate therefore making it harder to form your profile. I have tried all these steps and have noticed a scrambled ad profile when browsing the internet.


**Simple Steps**

1. DeGoogle your life
   Google is the biggest data merchant on the planet. You must remove yourself the most you can from it's sphere of influence.

   Browsers (DuckDuckGo) - Firefox, safari
   E-Mail - Proton
   Calender - Apple calender, zoho calender
   Writing - Word, Apple pages, Apache OpenOffice Writer,  Zoho Writer, LibreOffice Writer

2. VPN 
   VPN's have been marketed for annonomiziny your data but if you signin to a platform you giving them your data so they should really be used on the go and to gain access to to location restricted content. Find a VPN which only runs on it's servers ram.

   a. Apple Private relay
   b. ProtonVpn
   3. ExpressVpn

3. AI
   Ai is a new problem in the data broker war. Companies are collecting your data to train Ai and we dont know the consequences this could have so better to be safe than sorry. I suggest self hosting an LLM if all you need is a chatbot. (see HuggingFace for best local LLM's : https://huggingface.co/models)

   Avoid
     a. Google Gemini
     b. Perplexity
     c. Microsoft CoPilot

**Posioning**

1. Online Accounts
   Online Accounts are where we can really start affecting data algorithms. Your important accounts like your taxes or linkedIn should be the only places with accurate information. The         rest can changed to posion your Data.

     a. Social Media - Instagram, facebook, tiktok, SnapChat
         Thes accounts dont need to have accurate information. Dont post your face if you dont have too. Your age should be different on each platform. Make a unique Username for each account. Turn off location data in settings (especially SnapChat Maps).

     b. Blog and art sites. - Reddit, tumblr, DeviantArt etc..
         These accounts are mainly used for browsing and unless your trying to form an audience, they can be used
