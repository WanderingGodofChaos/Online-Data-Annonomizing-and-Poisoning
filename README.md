# Online-Data-Annonomizing-and-Poisoning
My steps to not just anonymize data but poison the data

For a long time data has been collected on us and sold to anyone whith enough money to buy it. I've been to to annonomize my data so the data brokers cant track me down for years but I've decided to go a step futher. Posion my public data. My thinking is if you annonomize most of your data they will still have good data on you to build a case file. I think if you give the algorithms a whole bunch of bad data, they wont be able to tell what is accurate therefore making it harder to form your profile. I have tried all these steps and have noticed a scrambled ad profile when browsing the internet.


**Simple Steps**

1. DeGoogle your life
   Google is the biggest data merchant on the planet. You must remove yourself the most you can from it's sphere of influence.

   Browsers (DuckDuckGo) - Firefox, safari
   E-Mail - Proton
   Calender - Apple calender, zoho calender
   Writing - Word, Apple pages, Apache OpenOffice Writer,  Zoho Writer, LibreOffice Writer

2. VPN 
   VPN's have been marketed for annonomiziny your data but if you signin to a platform you giving them your data so they should really be used on the go and to gain access to to location restricted content. Find a VPN which only runs on it's servers ram.

   a. Apple Private relay
   b. ProtonVpn
   3. ExpressVpn

3. Cookies and GPS
   One of the main ways data tracks you is from you geographical location and cookies (Your online location). On device settings can be tuned to turn these off. You'll be amazed on how many apps want to actively know your location! Cookies can also be disabled on most devices and can be diabled in browser. 
   
   
5. AI
   Ai is a new problem in the data broker war. Companies are collecting your data to train Ai and we dont know the consequences this could have so better to be safe than sorry. I suggest self hosting an LLM if all you need is a chatbot. (see HuggingFace for best local LLM's : https://huggingface.co/models)

   Avoid
     a. Google Gemini
     b. Perplexity
     c. Microsoft CoPilot

**Posioning**

1. Online Accounts
   Online Accounts are where we can really start affecting data algorithms. Your important accounts like your taxes or linkedIn should be the only places with accurate information. The         rest can changed to posion your Data.

     a. Social Media - Instagram, facebook, tiktok, SnapChat
         Thes accounts dont need to have accurate information. Dont post your face if you dont have too. Your age should be different on each platform. Make a unique Username for each account. Turn off location data in settings (especially SnapChat Maps).

     b. Blog and art sites. - Reddit, tumblr, DeviantArt etc..
         These accounts are mainly used for browsing and unless your trying to form an audience, they can be used totally wrong data. You open accounts with temporary emails. When answering the personalization questions answer as someone else or completley random, because data brokers will store your device ip adress with their logs these accounts will help scramble what youve put out. When the data algorithm stores the posioned data it wont be able to know lies from truth so it'll store it all and the more accounts you have with random data the better. (Each account should have a different profile).

    Example: A straight white male who's into sports --> Lesbain Indian transwoman who's into performance art.

2. Further reinforcing bad data
   When you begin to experince the results of you data manipulation and begin to see adds for things you dont like, you have the opportunity to clcik on these irrelevant adds to further reinforce the bad data on your profile.
